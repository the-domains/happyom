date info about:

**Upcoming Happy
Shoulders Partner Playshop**

On
Saturday Feb 12th I will be offering a 2-3 hour class in Happy Shoulders,
the modality I have been creating since 2009\. The class is designed for couples
or friends who like the work I do and would like the work I do and would like
to carefully explore on each other. I also welcome massage therapists who would
like to begin integrating and exploring some of the basic Happy Shoulders
concepts. 

In
the class, you will get a short lecture and demo explaining what we will be
working with, have fun in a couple short touch and listening exercises (taken
from the contact improve world) and get a chance to receive and give a full
happy shoulders session. You'll also be giving a lot of feedback to each other,
and to me and the group at the end.

I
am asking for comfortable pairs to sign up together, as you will have to be
vulnerable and surrendered and have to feel safe. I would not want someone I
don't feel good about randomly learning this stuff on my body. I will have at least one person prepared as a
standby extra incase someone really wants to come and doesn't have a partner
and I feel safe about you doing the experiment.
