Happy Shoulders

Tension Melting Movement Therapy and Relaxation Training

Ever feel like your shoulders are always tight?

Like getting massage but feel like the relief just doesn't last?

Do you wish someone could give you that one elusive release your looking for but can find?

**Let me free your wings!**

Happy Shoulders is a child of my hands on Yoga adjustments, and my Osteopathy based water training in Aquastretch. With wonderous intuitive hands honed well before age 10 on my mothers rocky shoulders and a lack of appropriate water environments to perform aquastretch, I have spent the last 6 years finding ways to move and support the body into deep stretching positions while intuitively hitting "that spot" and allowing tension to loosen. Illuminating peoples stress-tension allows people to see their own unconscious holding on and finally let go. 

Basically, I ask you to relax, and begin to carefully move your body through its entire range of motion while listening to your sensations both in my fingertips and sympathetically in my body. I use complex ways of stretching and lengthening areas that people haven't discovered in their bodies, while putting light pressure on the tightest spots. We frequently discover spasms, repetitive clicks, and most of all, positions that muscles refuse to relax in. Through the right coaching, listening, and touch, quiet comfort is usually found quickly, and the tension forcing joints to shift in compensation is alleviated.

There are many different potent massage and movement therapies. I have been blessed with hands and awareness that help people stretch and unwind and come back to balance. I offer this service as a private yoga teacher doing a hands on stretching lesson. I do all my work by donation, and my suggested offering is a menial Dollar a Minute for a session that may change your life in 20 minutes.

Its a pleasure for me to work with tough cases who are very sesitive or over stressed for years, and although each minute with me makes a noticeable difference, 2-3 sessions or more may be needed to get to the bottom of rare potent issues.

Free samples are always available. Some video examples will be posted soon. Many blessings :-)
